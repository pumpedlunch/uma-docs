# Solidity Examples

This section focuses on the Solidity code for important interactions with the Optimistic Oracle. We recommend starting with the [Getting Started](local-setup.md) tutorial that walks developers through setting up the [developer quickstart repo](https://github.com/UMAprotocol/dev-quickstart) and working with UMA contracts.

#### UMA Contract Lifecycle

UMA's Optimistic Oracle allows contracts to quickly request and receive price information. A request is made when a contract submits the following parameters with a request to the Optimistic Oracle contract:

* **identifier:** price identifier being requested.
* **timestamp:** timestamp of the price being requested.
* **ancillaryData:** additional arguments passed with the price request.
* **currency:** ERC20 token used for payment of rewards and fees. Must be approved for use with the DVM.
* **reward:** reward offered to a successful proposer. Will be paid by the caller. Note: this can be 0.

Proposers respond to price requests by referencing off-chain price feeds to submit the price of an asset. In return for their work they will receive a pre-defined proposal reward set by the Requestor. To propose prices, the Proposer is required to stake a proposal bond. In the event that the price information they proposed is disputed and deemed incorrect, the Proposer will lose their bond.

Disputers can refute a price submitted by a Proposer within the proposal liveness period by referencing their own off-chain price feeds. The proposal liveness period is a pre-defined amount of time a proposal can be disputed before the Requestor receives the price of the asset.

f Disputers do not refute the price submitted by the Proposer within the proposal liveness period, the price is sent to the Requestor. If a proposal is disputed, the price will be submitted to UMA’s DVM and resolved after a 48-96 hour voting period.

#### Integrating with the Optimistic Oracle

We continue to use the [OptimisticDepositBox](https://github.com/UMAprotocol/dev-quickstart/blob/main/contracts/OptimisticDepositBox.sol) contract as an example. The OptimisticDepositBox is a minimal financial contract that allows a user to deposit collateral into a contract and later withdraw their collateral corresponding to a desired USD amount. When the user wants to make a withdrawal, a price request is made to the Optimistic Oracle.

Let's first take a look at the OptimisticDepositBox constructor. Optimistic Oracle price requests require the use of a whitelisted identifier and collateral. The OptimisticDepositBox uses the protocol Finder to discover UMA protocol contracts and call the `isOnWhitelist` method on the `AddressWhitelist` and the `isIdentifierSupported` method on the `IdentifierWhitelist` contract to confirm both are whitelisted before deployment.

```solidity
constructor(
    address _collateralAddress,
    address _finderAddress,
    bytes32 _priceIdentifier,
    address _timerAddress
) nonReentrant() Testable(_timerAddress) {
    finder = FinderInterface(_finderAddress);
    require(_getIdentifierWhitelist().isIdentifierSupported(_priceIdentifier), "Unsupported price identifier");
    require(_getAddressWhitelist().isOnWhitelist(_collateralAddress), "Unsupported collateral type");
    collateralCurrency = IERC20(_collateralAddress);
    priceIdentifier = _priceIdentifier;
}

...

function _getIdentifierWhitelist() internal view returns (IdentifierWhitelistInterface) {
    return IdentifierWhitelistInterface(finder.getImplementationAddress(OracleInterfaces.IdentifierWhitelist));
}

function _getAddressWhitelist() internal view returns (AddressWhitelist) {
    return AddressWhitelist(finder.getImplementationAddress(OracleInterfaces.CollateralWhitelist));
}
```

Example arguments used to deploy the contract can be found and tested in the [OptimisticDepositBox fixture](https://github.com/UMAprotocol/dev-quickstart/blob/main/test/fixtures/OptimisticDepositBox.Fixture.ts). A whitelisted USDC contract is used for collateral, the Finder and Timer addresses use existing UMA ecosystem contracts that are deployed, and a price identifier that has been [whitelisted with the IdentifierWhitelist](https://github.com/UMAprotocol/dev-quickstart/blob/main/test/fixtures/UmaEcosystem.Fixture.ts#L29) contract.

```typescript
// Deploy the OptimisticDepositBox contract.
  const optimisticDepositBox = await (
    await getContractFactory("OptimisticDepositBox", deployer)
  ).deploy(usdc.address, parentFixture.finder.address, identifier, parentFixture.timer.address);
```

#### Requesting a Price

A price request is made when the `requestWithdrawal` [method](https://github.com/UMAprotocol/dev-quickstart/blob/main/contracts/OptimisticDepositBox.sol#L162) is called. A depositor submits the `denominatedCollateralAmount` to withdrawal and a `requestPrice` call is constructed with the following arguments [shown above](solidity-examples.md#requesting-a-price) and in the[ requestPrice interface](https://github.com/UMAprotocol/protocol/blob/master/packages/core/contracts/oracle/interfaces/OptimisticOracleInterface.sol#L45):

```solidity
function requestWithdrawal(uint256 denominatedCollateralAmount)
    public
    noPendingWithdrawal(msg.sender)
    nonReentrant
{
    OptimisticDepositBoxData storage depositBoxData = depositBoxes[msg.sender];
    require(denominatedCollateralAmount > 0, "Invalid collateral amount");

    // Update the position data for the user.
    depositBoxData.withdrawalRequestAmount = denominatedCollateralAmount;
    depositBoxData.withdrawalRequestTimestamp = getCurrentTime();

    emit RequestWithdrawal(msg.sender, denominatedCollateralAmount, depositBoxData.withdrawalRequestTimestamp);

    // A price request is sent for the current timestamp.
    _requestOraclePrice(depositBoxData.withdrawalRequestTimestamp);
}

.....

// Requests a price for `priceIdentifier` at `requestedTime` from the Optimistic Oracle.
function _requestOraclePrice(uint256 requestedTime) internal {
    OptimisticOracleInterface oracle = _getOptimisticOracle();
    // For other use cases, you may need ancillary data or a reward. Here, they are both zero.
    oracle.requestPrice(priceIdentifier, requestedTime, "", IERC20(collateralCurrency), 0);
}
```

After price request functionality has been implemented into your contracts, you can test your changes by creating a test in the developer quickstart repo similar to the OptimisticDepositBox test below:

```typescript
await expect(optimisticeDepositBox.connect(depositor).requestWithdrawal(amountToWithdraw))
  .to.emit(optimisticDepositBox, "RequestWithdrawal")
  .withArgs(depositor.address, amountToWithdraw, requestTimestamp);
```

#### Price Proposals

The code snippets above represent the core functionality for deploying a minimal contract and requesting a price. The next step in the contract lifecycle after a request has been made is a price can be proposed.&#x20;

[Here](https://github.com/UMAprotocol/protocol/blob/master/packages/core/contracts/oracle/implementation/OptimisticOracle.sol#L312) is the `proposePriceFor` function from the Optimistic Oracle contract that is used to propose a price for requests. The price proposal will revert if the parameters do not match an existing price request. For reference, the [developer quickstart repo](https://github.com/UMAprotocol/dev-quickstart/blob/main/test/OptimisticDepositBox.Proposal.ts#L26) demonstrates how to call the `proposePriceFor` method.

#### Liveness

An important aspect to consider when using the Optimistic Oracle is the liveness period which is the number of seconds a proposal must wait before a price can be resolved and contracts can be settled. A `defaultLiveness` value is set (currently 7,200) or developers can set a customLiveness value.

```typescript
request.expirationTime = getCurrentTime().add(
    request.customLiveness != 0 ? request.customLiveness : defaultLiveness
);
```

To set a `customLiveness` value with our OptimisticDepositBox example above, we could add line 5 to change the liveness period from 7,200 seconds to 3,600:

```solidity
function _requestOraclePrice(uint256 requestedTime) internal {
    OptimisticOracleInterface oracle = _getOptimisticOracle();
    // For other use cases, you may need ancillary data or a reward. Here, they are both zero.
    oracle.requestPrice(priceIdentifier, requestedTime, "", IERC20(collateralCurrency), 0);
    oracle.setCustomLiveness(priceIdentifier, requestedTime, "", 3600);
}
```

#### Proposal Bond

A proposal bond is a preloaded reward to incentivize price proposals. Similar to the liveness period, a custom bond amount can be set for a price request.&#x20;

Two important aspects to remember when setting a proposal bond is:

* When making a price request, the caller must approve the contract to transfer the value of the proposer reward for the collateral being used.
* The value corresponds to the collateral decimal value. So setting the reward to 1 for USDC that uses 6 decimals would be 1000000 while an 18 decimal token would be 1.&#x20;

The below shows an example of setting the proposer bond to 50 USDC (6 decimals):

```solidity
function _requestOraclePrice(uint256 requestedTime) internal {
    OptimisticOracleInterface oracle = _getOptimisticOracle();
    // For other use cases, you may need ancillary data. Here, the ancillary data is set to zero.
    oracle.requestPrice(priceIdentifier, requestedTime, "", IERC20(collateralCurrency), 0);
    oracle.setBond(priceIdentifier, requestedTime, "", 50000000);
}
```

#### Settlement

The OptimisticDepositBox contract uses the `executeWithdrawal` method to settle contracts. It first checks if a price has been resolved by calling the `hasPrice` method on the Optimistic Oracle which reverts if the request is not settled or settleable. If a price has been resolved, `settleAndGetPrice` is called.

```solidity
function _getOraclePrice(uint256 withdrawalRequestTimestamp) internal returns (uint256) {
    OptimisticOracleInterface oracle = _getOptimisticOracle();
    require(
        oracle.hasPrice(address(this), priceIdentifier, withdrawalRequestTimestamp, ""),
        "Unresolved oracle price"
    );
    int256 oraclePrice = oracle.settleAndGetPrice(priceIdentifier, withdrawalRequestTimestamp, "");

    // For simplicity we don't want to deal with negative prices.
    if (oraclePrice < 0) {
        oraclePrice = 0;
    }
    return uint256(oraclePrice);
}
```
